Beacon Color Detection
======================

In this tutorial you will use the phone's camera to detect which side of the
image has the red and blue beacon colors. This will rely on color detection,
clustering, and centroid algorithms. It will use the `OpenCV
<http://opencv.org/>`__ library to perform calculations, and has been already
added to the `pmtischler/ftc_app <https://github.com/pmtischler/ftc_app>`__
repo.

This tutorial's contents are coming soon.
